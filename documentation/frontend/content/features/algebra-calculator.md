The algebra calculator takes in an expression in the terminal with constants and any kind of variable excluding exponents. It can evaluate constants by addition or subtraction. Currently, it recognizes different variable terms. In a quick upcoming release, it will be able to evaluate expressions with variable terms as well. 

Sample input:

```
>>> 3 + 7
10

>>> 2 - 5
-3

>>> 3x + 4 - 6x + 2a - 3
3x + 4 - 6x + 2a - 3
```

Upcoming future release:

```
>>> 3x + 4 - 6x + 2a -3
-3x + 1+ 2a
```
