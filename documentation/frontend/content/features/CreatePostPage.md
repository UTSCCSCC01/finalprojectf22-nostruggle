### Posting a new question to the forum

The CreatePostPage creates a page that a user can post a new question on the forum.  There is a textfield for the title of the post and another textfield for the content of the post.  There are also tags for different categories that the post can belong to.  After the user types data into the textfield, they can click on the post button to add the post to the database.  Data is only written to the database if both the title and content text fields are filled.
