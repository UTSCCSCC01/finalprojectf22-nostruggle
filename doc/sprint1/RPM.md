## **Participants**: Christine, Catherine, Madison, Ishika, Tara, Zane

## **Release goal**:

The website should be set up to include a sign up, sign in, and forgot password page. As well, the main page with website contents should include a logout icon for exiting the account in use, a page to create and share posts with tags, a stopwatch and timer, a derivative calculator, and a linear algebra calculator. Not every task must be implemented for each user story, however, its basic user functionality in accessing and obtaining results should be implemented.   


# The below table indicates the specifications of the related user stories for sprint 1:

(Note: Certain functionalities that are incomplete will be pushed to the next sprint, and the acceptance criteria is in the sprint1 document)


### User Story 13: As a student learning math (Mark), I want to access the derivative calculator so that I can verify homework answers for calculus I
**Task Breakdown:**

*Tara*
- Figuring out how to translate input format (such as the coexistence of constants, variables, exponents, operations, etc) to a format that can be read by the program (3 hours)
- Logic in automating the derivative processes (polynomials, chain rule, constants) and implementing its calculations with JavaScript functions (6 hours) 
- Validating user input of equations involving the parentheses, values surrounding the +/- signs, and ensuring variables are in terms of x (4 hours)
- Creating input tools (ex. trig functions, variables, keyboard, etc) for client to use to enter the derivative, and displaying the result in a neat format (10 hours)
- Creating a step-by-step solution to display the answers (12 hours)


### User Story 16: As a user (Mark), I would like to schedule my day with a daily to-do list so that I can plan out activities/tasks in my day.
**Task Breakdown:**

*Christine*
- Creating the UI (20hrs)
- Sort tasks by a variety of filters (complete, deadline, title, time spentâ€¦) (2hrs)


### User Story 17: As a user (Mark), I would like to start and pause a stopwatch for the item on the to-do list that I am currently working on, so that I can track the amount of time spent on this activity.
**Task Breakdown:**

*Christine*
- Display to-do list items (5 hrs)
- Creating the UI (20hrs)


### User Story 18: As a user (Mark), I would like to view the stopwatch that is currently running so that I know how much time I spent on the current item
**Task Breakdown:**

*Christine*
- Logic for saving the time to the database (2hrs)
- Toggle the display of the timer (<1hr)


### User Story 19: As a user (Mark), I would like to mark an item on the to-do list as complete so that I could keep track of which items are completed.
**Task Breakdown:**

*Christine*
- Saving completion to the database ( < 1hr)


### User Story 15: As a student learning math (Mark), I want to access the linear algebra calculator so that I can verify homework answers for linear algebra courses.
**Task Breakdown:**

*Zane*
- Calculator interface design (2 days)
- UI/UX implementation (2 days)
- Implement calculator functionalities( Linear Algebra solvers: matrices, linear transformations, eigenvalues etc.) (3 days)


### User Story 23: As a web developer for No Struggle, I want to learn the necessary technologies including MERN stack in order to figure out how to implement my assigned user stories.

### User Story 5: As a registered user (Sarah/Mark), I want to view my profile so that I can edit my account details. - Assigned to Catherine
**Task Breakdown:**

*Catherine*
- Allow users to edit account details - 1 day
- Acceptance Criteria: While in the profile page, users can change their associated username, password and email.
- Implement UI for viewing profile - 4 hours
- Acceptance Criteria: Access to your profile where account details are displayed.
