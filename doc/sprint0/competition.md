# Competition 1: [Piazza](https:piazza.com)
## What is similar between NoStruggle and Piazza?
- Both products are designed to help students learn through collaboration.
- Both products showcase a forum where large groups of users can post and reply to threads.

## How does NoStruggle differ from Piazza?
- NoStruggle has a public community of users, where discussion topics are organized through various tags, such as project ideas, advice, and more!
- Users with different levels of experience can join forums to assist struggling students instead of instructor and TA roles in Piazza.  
- NoStruggle includes a toolkit of useful features, such as a calculator for courses like linear algebra and calculus.  
- NoStruggle encourages productivity management among users through our to-do list and study timers.

## In what scenarios does NoStruggle shine?
- NoStruggle is better for upper year students who want to help first year students since they can join the forum and answer questions for students, which they cannot join on Piazza unless if they are a TA.
- NoStruggle is better for students who want to keep track of time spent studying since our product includes features to manage studying time, which Piazza doesn’t include.

## Final message to our competitor
- Piazza doesn’t allow any upper year student to join the Piazza class since each class is intended for students taking the class, the TAs and the professors.  Piazza also doesn’t focus on studying time management which is why it doesn’t include study features.  For Piazza to include these features, it would need to change its objective from its current objective of being a professional class forum to a forum open to all students.

# Competition 2: [Symbolab](https://www.symbolab.com/)
## What is similar between NoStruggle and Symbolab?
- Both products include a calculator for solving math problems with a step by step solution.

## How does NoStruggle differ from Symbolab?
- The calculator in the NoStruggle toolkit is convieniently accessible from any page as a toggle on the side of the screen. 
- Users can easily paste a solution from the calculator toolkit while commenting in the community forum.
- Our toolkit includes more than just a calculator! Time management tools like a to-do list and study timer are there as well.

## In what scenarios does NoStruggle shine?
- NoStruggle is perfect for students who want to ask additional math questions in a forum after they use the calculator.

## Final message to our competitor
- Rather than encouraging learning through a collaborative effort, Symbolab focuses on calculations instead of being able to ask and answer questions. For Symbolab to address these scenarios, it would need to add a forum for people to ask their math questions on.


# Competition 3: [YPT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pallo.passiontimerscoped&pcampaignid=fdl_short&url=https://pallo.com/invite?groupId%3D1963183)
## What is similar between NoStruggle and YPT?
- Both products have timers and to-do lists to help students keep track of time spent studying.
- Both products have a leaderboard to see how long other people have been studying for.

## How does NoStruggle differ from YPT?
- NoStruggle has additional features that can help students to study, including a forum to ask questions on while they study as well as a toolkit with calculators.

## In what scenarios does NoStruggle shine?
- NoStruggle makes it easy for students to access help while studying without needing to leave the web application.

## Final message to our competitor
- YPT doesn’t offer additional study aids or a forum, as it focuses on managing study time.  For YPT to address this situation, it would need to offer subject specific study tools and a student collaboration forum to help students learn and study.
