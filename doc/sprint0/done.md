- All the code is well-written. That is, code is written and annotated when different developers are working on the same functionality.
- The code is peer-reviewed and explained if necessary.
- Full tests should be made. That is, testing should be done either with written tests or manually tested and all tests should pass.
- All functionality is covered and all the user stories should be satisfied once the coding is finished and fully tested.
