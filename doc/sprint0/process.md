# Decision Making:
- We made decisions based upon everyone’s approval. If there was a disagreement, we would either come up with compromises based on what everyone wanted, or come up with an entirely new solution. As well, we split off tasks based on people’s availability and comfort level in the sprint0  tasks.

# Prioritization of User Stories:
- The major features described in the user stories and distinguishable features from competitors were prioritized. This includes viewing the forums, accessing the math calculator, and viewing the timer. The other listed features are added later, for example upvotes and downvotes in forums.

# Meetings:
- During the days leading up to the deadline (Tuesday to Friday), we met daily at 8 pm in a Discord voice channel.

# Next Phase:
- Next phase, it will be a lot less stressful if we started the tasks for sprint 1 earlier. Since it is a heavy coding phase with little knowledge of tools we will use, it will be useful to watch tutorial videos working with react, nodejs, mongodb, and express during the first three days.
