# Motivation :
       Often first year students feel lost because of a lack of social circle and increasing   complexity of the material they study. Due to vast resources available on the internet , it becomes difficult for them to filter the applications and advice that are most productive to their learning. Upper year students who have a strong desire to help freshmen navigate university are unable to do so due to lack of connection. Our website is a one stop solution designed to help first year computer science students to connect with other students , join various forums to get ideas and their questions answered. We also have an essential toolkit to help our users with everyday calculations, linear algebra and calculus. In order to promote good study habits, there is also a study timer with which users can log their study hours and schedule tasks. The main incentive is to make all useful tools at one place to help students thrive in every way possible.

### Do you use git flow?

Feature branches will be used to develop new features and will be merged to the developer branch. Each time during a partial release of the project , a release branch will be created . A hotfix branch will also be created to make hotfixes.

 ### Do you use github issues or another ticketing website?
